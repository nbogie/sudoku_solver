What is it?
===========

A private learning exercise.

A haskell beginner's attempt to port Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver to Haskell from the original Python found at http://norvig.com/sudoku.html

If you are looking for a good sudoku solver in Haskell, I recommend looking at those on the Haskell wiki: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Sudoku

Norvig already links to a haskell implementation of his approach: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-August/031049.html 

Warning: Hazardous!
===================

This is not an example of good Haskell!

This Haskell implementation is neither complete, correct, well-performing, nor is it idiomatic Haskell.  Don't try to learn from it, except if you're looking to find bad practices.
